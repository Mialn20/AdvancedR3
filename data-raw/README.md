# Contents of data folder

## Contains:

-   `nmr-omics/`: \#
-   `lipidomics.xlsx`: \# the lipidomics data used in the project.
-   `nmr-omics.R`: \# Should contain the *raw* (unedited) data used
    specifically for the scientific project and product (e.g. the
    manuscript).

While ideally the original raw data used for the project should be
stored here, this isn't always possible. At the minimum, include
instructions on how to access the raw data or where it came from.
